                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I have had a curiosity about how things worked. I completed my schooling from R. R. I. C Inter College, Patti, Pratapgarh (UP) and passed 12th in 2019. Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (2022â€“2026) at Malwa Institute of Science & Technology, Indore.

                <br />
               

<p>
                I started programming more seriously in 12th standard,
                initially learning how to scrape and interact with websites.
                I went on to do a ton of passion projects, many of them with
                my closest friends,
